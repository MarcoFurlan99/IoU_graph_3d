**1)** *Results_1_1* is the output of a big computation with 20 datasets (4h 9m).
**2)** *Results_2_1*, *Results_2_2*, *Results_2_3* are multiple iterations of the same algorithm running.
 
 From **1)** we can deduce that BN adaptation can improve performance (and does so on average), BUT it can also make it worse and it's hard to grasp a pattern for when it does what.
 From **2)** We can see that results are not necessarily consistent upon different iterations (depend on the specifics of the dataset)
 
 More datasets are being generated to deepen the understanding of this behaviour.
