*1)* **Results_1_1** is the output of a big computation with 20 datasets (4h 9m).

*2)* **Results_2_1**, **Results_2_2**, **Results_2_3** are the outputs of smaller computations with 5 datasets each (16m).

From *1)* we can deduce that BN adaptation can improve performance (and does so on average), BUT it can also make it worse and it's hard to grasp a pattern for when it does what.

From *2)* We can see that results are not necessarily consistent upon different iterations (depend on the specifics of the dataset)

I'm generating more datasets to deepen the understanding of this behaviour.
